# Reverse-Engineer
Alongside the Holy Book of x86, I decided to start to write Reverse Enginnering Tutorials, Tips and Tricks, anti-debugging, obfuscation, etc. My friend Kami (@_k4m1_) and I (@arash_tc) will be the first and main contributors of this project. Other contributors and technical reviewers are highly appreciated. More info will be posted about the progress of the project (write ups) on twitter and Linkedin.
